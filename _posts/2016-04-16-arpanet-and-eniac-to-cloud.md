## Evolution of Cloud Computing

Cloud Computing is a "daily spoken" & most commonly used terminology in every forum. Every conversation with a CIO has a reference to cloud computing. 

_Cloud computing as the name indicates is derived from the concept of Internet. Before and by 2000, Internet is referred as Cloud. When ever you have to show internet in an illustration, you will show it as a cloud. As internet is connection of computers & further you cant see internet as an entity, its depicted as cloud. _

ARPANET TO CLOUD: 

The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) was one of the world's first operational packet switching networks, the first network to implement TCP/IP, and the progenitor of what was to become the global Internet.
The concept of delivering computing resources through a global network is rooted in the sixties. We have multiple sources for evolution & we will address 
Organizational (KEY) contributors: 
ARPANET
CERN
Intel
Netscape
Microsoft
Apple
VMWare

ENIAC TO CLOUD:

Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC) was the first electronic general-purpose computer. 
It was Turing-complete, digital, and capable of being reprogrammed to solve "a large class of numerical problems.

As organizations went global, the web architecture & span of internet facilitated the globalization process.
